This repository houses a comprehensive Spring Boot Microservices project, designed to facilitate efficient and modular development in a distributed architecture. The microservices included are:

Product Service: Manages product-related functionalities, ensuring seamless interactions for product-related operations.

Order Service: Handles order processing, tracking, and management, ensuring a streamlined workflow for order-related activities.

Notification Service: Responsible for handling notifications and communication between various components, enhancing real-time updates and alerts.

Inventory Service: Manages inventory-related operations, providing a centralized system for tracking and managing stock levels.

This project aims to showcase best practices for building scalable and maintainable microservices using the Spring Boot framework. Each microservice is independently deployable and communicates through well-defined APIs, promoting flexibility and modularity in your system architecture. Feel free to explore, contribute, and leverage these microservices as a foundation for your distributed systems.
